    "<br><br>In the realm of <b>Alice in Borderland</b>, characters find themselves in a distant fantasy land called Borderland, where survival hinges on engaging in death-defying challenges to earn precious lives. Win, and you gain additional days to live; lose, and it could cost you your life. When their visas expire, players face the threat of being instantly eliminated by a laser. The only way to stay alive is to engage in a series of challenging games.\n",
